Going Blast is the world's first on-chain gamified auction house. Compete in auctions to place the final bid, win NFTs, ERC20s, and cash prizes, join a rune to win or lose as a team, all the while sending messages to the other runes and bidders you've just outbid. And even the losers win through our proof-of-bid mechanism which rewards any and all bids.

Going Blast features bid-cost auctions. Each bid you place costs $1.00, and increases the final price of the auction by $0.01. Auctions have a ticking clock, and if the timer hits 0, the last bidder wins. Each bid resets the timer and keeps the auction going. Our auctions put you head to head in a battle of attrition and wits. Everyone has the opportunity to win an auction with a single bid of $1.00, as long as you've Gone Last. Auctions can feature cash prizes, NFTs, points, and ERC20s of our partner projects.

Auctions are created by the Going Blast protocol, using funds from the ever growing treasury. Check our roadmap below to see when individuals or partner projects can start creating their own auctions.

The team behind Going Blast has already built and released Summit Swap (@summitdefi), a blast native 0-fee DEX aggregator. We are a team experienced in combining gamification with strong project tokenomics and foundations. We have partnered with Blastopians, Blasterswap, Alchemy, Puglife, Stryke (formerly Dopex), and many others to bring Going Blast to life.


### $GO

$GO is the protocol's primary token. $GO is emitted from farms via proof-of-bid, which can be explored in detail below. $GO will only be emitted for 2 years, broken up into 8 three-month epochs. At the end of each epoch a halving event will occur. $GO holders earn the revenue from the auctions and are given access to premium auctions (more prizes and less competition). $GO is a finite resource (capped at 1M tokens), and you're either GOing or GOne. Going Blast is designed to maintain consistent growth of $GO value, and the auctions are designed to maintain a floor price.


**The first auction run on Going Blast will be a premium auction (only available to $GO holders) on sun June 17th. The LBP is the only way to get your $GO before then, and this auction will be our thank you to our initial supporters.**


### Tokenomics

The Going Blast protocol is fueled by the bidding fees earned through the auctions. Bidding fees are used to grow the treasury and are distributed to $GO holders through our staking pool. $GO holders (and stakers) also have access to weekly premium auctions. Premium auctions reward our community members by preventing the public from bidding. They have higher prize pots, higher emissions, and lower number of bidders due to the requirement of holding at least 250 $GO.

$GO has a capped supply of 1M tokens, distributed as follows:
- 60%: proof-of-bid emissions
- 20%: initial LBP offering (remaining tokens burned)
- 10%: staking emissions (6 months)
- 5%: initial liquidity
- 5%: team treasury

### Proof-of-Bid

Proof-of-Bid is a new concept of mining the protocol tokens, and is what powers the entire Going Blast protocol. While most people are familiar with PoV and PoS, PoB takes mining tokens to the next level.

PoB is integrated with the Going Blast auctions. Each bid placed on any auction mines tokens for the bidder. The final amount of tokens earned by each bidder is determined based on the total amount of bids in the auction. If an auction has 1000 $GO emissions allocated, and the auction finishes with 2000 bids in total, a user who bid 10 times would earn 5 $GO.

Emissions are allocated to each auction when that auction is created. Emission amount is dependent on the current epoch, whether the auction is premium or not, special events, and $GO governance voting.

#### Epochs

PoB emissions are divided into 8 three-month epochs. Emissions will last 2 years in total, after which no more $GO will be emitted through the auctions. Each epoch has half the emissions of the previous. The epochs are designed to incentivize early adopters of the platform, while maintaining price stability and preventing flooding.

#### Emission Tax

If proof-of-bid emissions are harvested within the first 30 days of the auction ending, they are taxed at 50%, with the taxed amount being burned. After 30 days, emissions mature and can be harvested with no tax. This emission tax is implemented to prevent prevent dumping and promote price stability.

Alternatively, proof-of-bid emissions can be harvested directly into the staking pool without paying the early harvest tax. In the staking pool these emissions start earning profits from the auction, as well as $GO and $VOUCH emissions. NOTE: harvesting directly to the staking pool will lock the staked funds for the duration of the tax period.

### Due Diligance

The Going Blast contracts are available on github here TODO: link
Architect (our engineer) is happy to walk users through the contracts / tests / coverage

Going Blast is currently live on the Blast Sepolia testnet. If you would like access join our discord here and request access.

**We are self-funded, not backed by any VCs, and have not had any private sales. Going Blast is designed to be as fair as possible, and our launch is exclusively through Fjord Foundry to work towards that goal.**

### Going Blast

**The world's first on-chain gamified auction house.**

#### How it Works

**Bid to Win**: Each bid costs a flat $1.00 and raises the auction price by $0.01.

**Keep the Clock Ticking**: The clock ticks down, and when it hits 0, the last bidder wins. But each new bid resets the 2 minute timer and extends the auction by 2 mins.

**Sold to the Last Bidder**: Auctions can feature cash prizes, NFTS, point and ERC20s of our partner projects. You could win with just a single $1.00 bid, as long as you’ve Gone Last.

#### Powered by the Community

The team behind Going Blast has already built and released Summit Swap (@summitdefi), a blast native 0-fee DEX aggregator. We are a team experienced in combining gamification with strong project tokenomics and foundations.

Auctions are created by the Going Blast protocol, using funds from the ever growing treasury. Check our roadmap below to see when individuals or partner projects can start creating their own auctions.

#### Trusted Partners

We’ve partnered with Blastopians, Blasterswap, Alchemy, Puglife, Stryke (formerly Dopex) and many others to bring Going Blast to life.

#### Mark your Calendars

**The first premium auction, exclusive to $GO holders, will take place on Sunday, June 16th, and is our way of thanking our initial supporters. The LBP is the only way to get your go before the 16th of June. Don’t miss your chance to participate early and secure your $GO.**
  


### Tokenomics

**$GO** is the protocol’s primary token. $GO is emitted from auctions via proof-of bid (further details below).

**Limited Emission**: $GO will only be emitted for two years, broken up into eight three-month epochs, with a halving event at the end of each epoch.  The total supply is capped at 1 million tokens, making go a finite resource. 

**Holder Benefits**: $GO holders earn revenue from the auctions and are given access to premium auctions with better prizes and less competition. $GO (and GO-ETH LP) staked in the pool also earns $VOUCH, and a little bonus kicker of $GO on the side.

**Sustained Growth**: Going Blast is designed to maintain consistent growth of $GO value, with the auctions structured to maintain a stable floor price.

### Proof-of-Bid (PoB)

Proof-of-Bid is a groundbreaking approach to mining protocol tokens, and powers the entire Going Blast protocol.

PoB is integrated with Going Blast auctions. Each bid placed on any auction mines tokens for the bidder. The total number of tokens a bidder earns is based on the total bids placed in the auction. For example, if an auction has 1000 $GO emissions allocated, and the auction finishes with 2000 bids in total, a user who placed 10 bids would earn 5 $GO.


#### Epochs

PoB emissions are divided into 8 three-month epochs, lasting a total of two years. After this period, no more $GO will be emitted through the auctions. Each epoch’s emissions are halved compared to the previous, encouraging early adoption, maintaining price stability and preventing flooding.

#### Emission Tax

**Early Harvest Tax**: PoB emissions harvested within the first 30 days of an auction ending are taxed at 50%, with the taxed amount being burned. This tax is implemented to prevent dumping and promote price stability. 

**Mature Emissions**: After 30 days, emissions mature and can be harvested with no tax.

**Staking Pool Option**: Emissions can instead be harvested and locked in the staking pool directly to skip the tax and 30 day maturing period.

### Due Diligance

The Going Blast contracts are available on github, we are happy walk users through the contracts / tests / coverage.

Going Blast is currently live on the Blast testnet. If you would like access join our discord and request access.

**We are self-funded, not backed by any VCs, and have not had private sales. Going Blast is designed to be as fair as possible, and our launch is exclusively through Fjord Foundry to work towards that goal.**
